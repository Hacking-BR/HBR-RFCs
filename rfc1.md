# Information Society

> An information society is a society where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital information and communication technologies, which have resulted in an information explosion and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the economy, education, health, warfare, government and democracy. The people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.

> The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these. Information society is seen as the successor to industrial society. Closely related concepts are the *post-industrial society (Daniel Bell)*, post-fordism, post-modern society, knowledge society, telematic society, Information Revolution, liquid modernity, and *network society (Manuel Castells)*.

# The human evolution

The oppression drives the society evolution.
The oppressed is always invisible, excluded. Every individual feels some oppression. 
Tech professionals suffer oppressions also, maybe more than normal professionals.

Education is the main action for achieving the goals, so let's present the 3 points from educator Paulo Freire, linking the anthropology of the oppressed with a method to teach.

| Anthropology                       |  Method                |
| ---------------------------------  | ---------------------- |
| 1 - to be curious (fundamental)    | 1 - Reading the world  |
| 2 - be unfinished, incomplete,   (needs the other)   | 2 - Thematization   (what people know)    |
| 3 - being connective, sharing with the other the transformation of the world (evolution of the human being)  | 3 - Problematization  (Philosophy/Awareness) | 

Paulo Freire warns about the importance of the practice, so learning must be done on living process and studying day-to-day activities.

The results of the education will be consolidated when the individual exercises the evolution and freedom.

# Liberty

Liberty is a matter of exercising needings and desires. It's an individual issue.
The importance of individuality must be noted, so we could understand each problem and needing that drive the society.
The importance of connectivity between the individuals must be noted, so each issue could be shared and solved in a cooperative way.
We live in a society under transformation and the abbility to share the transformations will permit the liberty.

# Freedoms

The GPL License and the GNU project, by *Richad Stallman* affirm that we must have 4 freedoms when dealing with some software, service or knowledge:

1. Freedom to *USE*
2. Fredom to *DISTRIBUTE*
3. Freedom to *UNDERSTAND*
4. Fredom to *MODIFY*

It's to much important to not fell under traps. The term *Open Source* (as used by *Bruce Perens* and *Erik Raymond*) hides the possibility to be opressed by external authorities. We can accept these term with care and only for the purpose of bringing those products to the freedom, in a transitional manner.

The learning process must be aimed to solve and realize our individual desires and needings, not to be a mean of oppression, where we obey orders from others.

We must consider that using some products as Apple, Microsoft Windows, Facebook, WhatsUp, Linkedin, Google, etc, means we are putting ourselfs under the domination of some oligarchies. Products like those can be used only for the purpose of discovering the oppressed indivivuals and bringing then to their natural freedom rights.

As a Collective, all individuals must be allways included.

We need to understand that we are all equal but at the same time different.

- The Society Organization must be made with the observation of each individual.

- Must be focused on the Diversity.

# Means

- Concepts

    - Technology workers are the main edge for influencing any production system.

    - All means of production have to use some services on the information tecnology area. 

    - The TIC's are the root of contemporary society.

- Actions 

    - Drive the educational process to free each individual on the right to human evolution.

		- Create opportunities, products, tools, services, events, etc where individuals can exercise their evolution and freedom.

# Members

Create ways and tools to collect members metadata, so we can understand diversity, desires, needings and drive the educational process.

# Partners

Possible partners in the Educational, Production and Infrastructure areas must be identified and invited to share our values.
